## Profile
Hello, I’m Selen, a 3rd-year Computer Engineering student at Bülent Ecevit University. During my first year at university, I joined the B-DISPATE Aerospace and Space team, where we completed the Technofest 2022 Model Satellite Competition, finishing 11th. Throughout this experience, I gained valuable insights working alongside my teammates.

I realized the importance of improving myself and contributing to projects, particularly in the realm of software development. I developed flight software using C/C++ languages on the Arduino IDE, shaping it around PID control. Additionally, I focused on establishing inter-system communication by working with various sensors and microcontrollers, learning to employ different communication protocols.

Furthermore, I mastered the art of teamwork, collaborating systematically with teammates from various units and contributing to their work. In my second year at university, I had the opportunity to participate in the Cyber Homeland Project under BAKKA, where I further developed my skills through an ethical hacking course. Additionally, I enhanced my abilities by attending an IoT course and obtained a certificate by creating a smart miner helmet.

Currently, my focus lies in the realms of artificial intelligence and deep learning. My team and I have been granted support under TUBITAK 2209-A, and we are working towards enhancing our project accordingly. Our project encompasses areas such as image processing, deep learning, sound processing, natural language processing, API design, and interface design, allowing me to further refine my skills.
